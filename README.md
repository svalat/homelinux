What it is ?
------------

Homelinux is a simple package manager to handle installation of packages in your home directory by rebuilding them from sources.
The main use case if a user (or developper) running into a non root environnement and needs some extra-package he can't or don't want
to install into the system. Thanks to HomeLinux you can handle the installation of the source package by checking the dependencies
available on the current system and automatically installing the missing one.
